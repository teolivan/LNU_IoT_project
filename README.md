+ **Short project overview //edit this**
+ **Approximate time taken to do this project: 50hrs**


## Objective
### Why you chose the project
I chose this project because...
### What purpose does it serve
The projects serves the purpose of...
### What insights you think it will give
The project will give me a better insight into how microcontrollers work. It will broaden my understanding of communication protocols, and how microcontrollers can communicate with sensors and activators.

## Material 
### List of material
+ Raspberry Pi Pico W
+ Breadboard
+ add more...
### What the different things (sensors, wires, controllers) do - short specifications
The raspberry Pi Pico W is a microcontroller which essentially is a small computer. The microcontroller is the so called master, controlling all of the other components (slaves), acting as the brain. The breadboard makes it easier for me to connect all of the devices together, as it provides slots for the different devices to be inserted into, and makes the task of connecting the devices together with wires less messy. 
### Where you bought them and how much they cost
I bought all of the components from electrokit.com. I bought a Start Kit, which contained all of the components needed for my project. The components costed 399kr in total and can be found here: https://www.electrokit.com/en/start-kit-applied-iot-at-linnaeus-university-2023.
