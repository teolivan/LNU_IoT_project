+ **Olivia Svensson - os222ui**
+ **Short project overview //edit this**
+ **Approximate time taken to do this project: 50hrs**


## Objective
Describe why you have chosen to build this specific device. What purpose does it serve? What do you want to do with the data, and what new insights do you think it will give?
### Why you chose the project
I chose this project because...
### What purpose does it serve
The projects serves the purpose of...
### What insights you think it will give
The project will give me a better insight into how microcontrollers work. It will broaden my understanding of communication protocols, and how microcontrollers can communicate with sensors and activators.

## Material 
Explain all material that is needed. All sensors, where you bought them and their specifications. Please also provide pictures of what you have bought and what you are using.
### List of material
+ Raspberry Pi Pico W
+ Breadboard
+ add more...
### What the different things (sensors, wires, controllers) do - short specifications
The Raspberry Pi Pico W is a microcontroller which essentially is a small computer. The microcontroller is the so called master, controlling all of the other components (slaves), acting as the brain. The breadboard makes it easier for me to connect all of the devices together, as it provides slots for the different devices to be inserted into, and makes the task of connecting the devices together with wires less messy. 
### Where you bought them and how much they cost
I bought all of the components from electrokit.com. I bought a Start Kit, which contained all of the components needed for my project. The components costed 399kr in total and can be found here: https://www.electrokit.com/en/start-kit-applied-iot-at-linnaeus-university-2023.

## Computer Setup 
How is the device programmed. Which IDE are you using. Describe all steps from flashing the firmware, installing plugins in your favorite editor. How flashing is done on MicroPython. The aim is that a beginner should be able to understand.
### Chosen IDE
### How the code is uploaded
### Steps that you needed to do for your computer. Installation of Node.js, extra drivers, etc.

## Putting Everything Together
How is all the electronics connected? Describe all the wiring, good if you can show a circuit diagram. Be specific on how to connect everything, and what to think of in terms of resistors, current and voltage. Is this only for a development setup or could it be used in production?
### Circuit diagram (can be hand drawn)
### *Electrical calculations

## Platform
Describe your choice of platform. If you have tried different platforms it can be good to provide a comparison.
### Describe platform in terms of functionality
### *Explain and elaborate what made you choose this platform

## The code
Import core functions of your code here, and don't forget to explain what you have done! Do not put too much code here, focus on the core functionalities. Have you done a specific function that does a calculation, or are you using clever function for sending data on two networks? Or, are you checking if the value is reasonable etc. Explain what you have done, including the setup of the network, wireless, libraries and all that is needed to understand.

## Transmitting the Data / Connectivity
How is the data transmitted to the internet or local server? Describe the package format. All the different steps that are needed in getting the data to your end-point. Explain both the code and choice of wireless protocols.
### How often is the data sent?
### Which wireless protocols did you use (WiFi, LoRa, etc …)?
### Which transport protocols were used (MQTT, webhook, etc …)
### *Elaborate on the design choices regarding data transmission and wireless protocols. That is how your choices affect the device range and battery consumption.

## Presenting the Data
Describe the presentation part. How is the dashboard built? How long is the data preserved in the database?
### Provide visual examples on how the dashboard looks. Pictures needed.
### How often is data saved in the database.
### *Explain your choice of database.
### *Automation/triggers of the data.

## Finalizing the Design
Show the final results of your project. Give your final thoughts on how you think the project went. What could have been done in an other way, or even better? Pictures are nice!
### Show final results of the project
### Pictures
### *Video presentation
